# Frequently Asked Questions
## I just got the game, how do I get started?
Check out our [beginner's guide](/beginners-guide.html)!

## How do I get more songs?
> [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com) is the master repository of custom songs made by the community. Many other tools and sites enhance the experience of downloading custom songs, but this site is the source of truth.

If you download maps manually from BeatSaver, extract them into a folder and place the files in `Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels`. This is the directory that the game natively reads custom maps from.

### BeastSaber
[Beast Saber](https://www.bsaber.com) is a review site that aims to curate all of the songs on BeatSaver. You can also download playlists, follow mappers, find songs using advanced sorting methods and more.

### Song Management Tools
The following are programs to be used on the desktop to help you download custom songs, with some other features as well.
* [Beat Saber Downloader](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWedF77hWYbqcigIWa2UcpXlhqGTjwR1/view) a map downloader by Sturdyfool0.
* [BeatList](https://github.com/Alaanor/beatlist) is an app to manage playlist and beatmaps, by Alaanor. 

## How do I install playlists?
Place the playlist file into `Beat Saber/Playlists` and select it in-game, then hit download. You can create playlists using one of the programs above.

## How do I make my own custom levels?
See [mapping](/mapping/)!

## How do I load plugins that aren't in Mod Assistant?
See [this section](/pc-modding.md#manual-installation) in the beginners guide.

## How does the multiplayer mod work?
Multiplayer is available Officially as of update 1.12.X. However, the Multiplayer Mod by Andruzzzhka allows for easier ways to play custom songs, as well as more than five players.
If you want to use the multiplayer mod instead of the Official Multiplayer, [You can find information Here.](https://bs.assistant.moe/Multiplayer/)
**Note:** This mod has not been updated to version 1.12.X yet, and may not be 100% Compatible.

## My game updated and now none of my mods are working!
Each time the game updates it is possible *(and very likely)* that your existing mods will stop working and need to be updated.
The devs realized this, so when the game updates and you run it for the first time, everything in the `Plugins` folder is moved into the `Incompatible Plugins` folder. **Leave those plugins in there!**

To get mods back, simply **run the installer again.**  
The BeatMods repository only includes mods that have been confirmed to work on the latest version of the game!

If you're confused by any of this, visit [Beginners Guide](/beginners-guide.md).

## How does the scoring system work in Beat Saber? How does global ranking work?
We have sections on the [grips and tricks](/grips-and-tricks.md) page dedicated to the scoring and ranking systems, check them out!

## My menus are blank and I have nothing to click on!
If the main window in your game is blank, your save file likely got corrupted.

To fix it, navigate to:
`%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Hyperbolic Magnetism`

Delete or rename the Beat Saber folder to something else. When you re-enter the game, it'll recreate the save file and should load the main menu properly.
