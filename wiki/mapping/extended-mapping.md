## Set-Up

**Install Mapping Extensions with Beat Saber Installed**
Note: This section assumes you have not pointed Mediocre Map Assistant 2 to a different location for your WIP maps. Skip ahead if you don’t have the game or want to store your WIP maps elsewhere.

1. Start Beat Saber and then close out after the game finishes loading. This is to ensure the game is ready for mods to be installed.
2. Open ModAssistant
Make sure the version selected in the dropdown is compatible with the Beat Saber version installed on your computer.
Check the checkbox for MappingExtensions. (You can select additional mods to install as well.)
Click Install and Update and make sure there are no errors.
Open Beat Saber again to initialize the mods you have installed then quit the game.

To check if it worked navigate to your Beat Saber install and make sure that a MappingExtensions.dll file is present.

	Oculus: \Oculus Apps\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Plugins
	Steam: \Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Plugins

	Note: These paths are relative, you will need to complete the path fully based on where your install is. Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Plugins

You are now ready to do map setup!
	
	Install Mapping Extensions without Beat Saber or Maps Stored Elsewhere for Mediocre Mapper
Here you will need to “trick” Mediocre Map Assistant 2 that your folder is a Beat Saber install.

Option 1:
Download this zip for pre-formatted folders and Mapping Extensions Plugin here.
Extract the zip to a location of your choice
Enter the path to the CustomLevels and CustomWIPLevels folder when Mediocre Mapper asks for the location. Note: The path can also be modified in the Settings Bar when you open the program, the options are near the bottom of the bar.
You are now ready to do map setup!
	
Option 2:
Create a folder named `Beat Saber` in the location you want to store your maps.
In that folder, create two folders, `Beat Saber_Data` and `Plugins`
In `Beat Saber_Data` create a `CustomWIPLevels` and `CustomLevels` folder
Enter the path to the CustomLevels and CustomWIPLevels folder when Mediocre Mapper asks for the location. Note: The path can also be modified in the Settings Bar when you open the program, the options are near the bottom of the bar.
If you have maps already go ahead and move your maps to `CustomWIPLevels` you just created.
Go to the “Plugins” folder you made, and drop the latest MappingExtensions.dll inside which can be found on BeatMods.
You are now ready to do map setup!

Map Setup in Mediocre Map Assistant 2
Open Mediocre Map Assistant 2
In the Settings bar on the right, 3 new tick box options should be available under the Beta section
6 Lane Mode - Extends the number of lanes available to map blocks to to 6 from 4. Also enables placement of walls outside of the lanes.
Precision Placement - Allows blocks, walls, and bombs to be placed at a finer resolution than the current grid.
Prevision Rotation - Allows blocks to be angled at any angle instead of the default 45-degree increments
Enable the desired features by clicking the checkboxes. For example wall mapping needs 6 Lane and Precision Placement.
Select the level you want to map in and click on the ExtraFields tab to the right of the difficulty select.
Click the Requirements tab and then type in Mapping Extensions. Note that this has to be exact or else the features will not enable.
Click the Add button to add it to the requirements
Click Save song infos in the bottom left corner.
Click Edit Level and you are good to go!
