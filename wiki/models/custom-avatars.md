# Custom Avatars
## Installation
The latest Custom Avatar plugin can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG discord or in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant).
Once installed you should see a file called `CustomAvatar.dll` inside your `Plugins` folder. You should also see a folder called `CustomAvatars` in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md) â€” this is where you will be placing the `*.avatar` files you want to use. 

You can download more avatars on [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Avatars/).

## Usage
Inside the game in the main menu you will see an `AVATARS` button at the top left of the Mods menu over by the release notes. Pressing it will open up the menu you can use to select which avatar you want to use. There's also additional settings you can change, such as avatar scaling and if the avatar is visible in first person.

::: warning
Some avatars were not made with first person view in mind, so they might block your vision if enabled.

::: warning
Avatars are not selected by default. Make sure to go into the right menu and switch to an avatar if none appear at first.

## Creating Avatars
[Assistant's Avatar Guide](/models/avatars-guide.html) is a good resource for learning how to make your own avatar.

The guide includes a [short video narrated by Megalon](/models/avatars-guide.html#videos), however it is intended to be an overview and you should watch it in addition to reading the guide, not lieu of.
