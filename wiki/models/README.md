# 3D Models
All custom model plugins were created separately by different people. Each mod has its own dedicated page detailing installation and usage instructions. These are listed below and in the sidebar.

* [Custom Sabers](./custom-sabers.md)
* [Custom Avatars](./custom-avatars.md)
* [Custom Platforms](./custom-platforms.md)
* [Custom Notes](./custom-notes.md)
* [Custom Walls](./custom-walls.md)
