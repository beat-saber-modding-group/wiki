# Custom Sabers
## Installation
If you are on PC, the latest Custom Saber plugin can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG discord or in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant). If you are on the quest, the custom sabers mod can be found on [BMBF](https://bsmg.wiki/quest-modding.html). Run ModAssistant, select the Custom Saber plugin, and click Install.
Once you've installed it you will see a folder called `CustomSabers` in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md), this is where you should place the `*.saber` files you want to use. 

You can download more sabers on [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Sabers/).

## Usage
Inside the game in the main menu you will see a `CUSTOM SABERS` button at the top left of the Mods menu over by the release notes. Pressing it will open up the menu you can use to select which sabers you want to use.
::: tip NOTE
Once selected, the sabers will only show up only while a song is playing and not while in the menu.
